            Johnny was a chemist&#39;s son <br/>
            His head stuffed full of brains <br/>
            While Johnny&#39;s thoughts were rocket ships, <br/>
            Other kids&#39; thoughts were trains
        </p>
        <p id="second">
            Johnny&#39;s father noticed Johnny <br/>
            Seldom saw the light of day <br/>
            So Johnny&#39;s father pushed pale Johnny <br/>
            Out into the sun to play.

        <p id="third">
            Johnny couldn&#39;t swing a bat <br/>
            Johnny couldn&#39;t catch a ball <br/>
            Science was his life-long love <br/>
            His home, the lecture hall

            "Outside is too unpredictable, <br/>
            I need some time to think. <br/>
            Besides, the sun is parching me, <br/>
            And I think I need a drink!"
