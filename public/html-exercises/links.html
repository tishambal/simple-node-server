            <em>My Top 3 Movie Picks</em>
            <p>
                My top 1 movie is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDlXdujRSD8">Flipped</a> because it was in this movie that made me truly differentiate infatuation from love in the simplest way possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                My top 2 movie would have to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0SKf0K3bxg">Juno</a> because aside from the fact that the soundtrack of this movie is also my favorite, I love how this movie gave a different light on teenage pregnancy.</p>
            </p>
            <p>
                
                Lastly, my third favorite movie is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Krh1koDU2uE">We Bought a Zoo</a> because this movie just simlply moved me.</p>

            <em>Tisha's Top 3 Favorite Songs</em>
            <p>
                The third spot goes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbN0nX61rIs">Shake it Out by Florence + The Machine</a>. This is the song that I listen to when I had a bad day or something did not go my way. It is my anti-bad vibe song. 
            </p>
              
            <p>
                Next is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkYgQBuXhes">D-D-Dance by Royal concpets</a>. This song is my ultimate feel good song--I listen to this song when I feel like every thing will go my way on a particular day. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, the top spot goes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05ROcQpVbKw">Let Your Love Grow Tall by Passion Pit</a>. I love how listening to this song lets me relax, slow down, and eventually put me in deep thought.
