            I studied highschool in <abbr title ="St. Paul College of Pasig">SPCP</abbr> and went on to college at The University of the Philippines Los Banos. Since I am a wide reader, my list of favorite books range from inspirational and motivational books like <cite>The Secret</cite> by Rhonda Byrne and <cite>The Alchemist</cite> by Paulo Coelho to Chic Lits like <cite>Liar Liar Pants on Fire</cite> by Meg Cabot and <cite>Twenties Girl</cite> by Sophie Kinsella. The most memorable quotation I learned from highschool is more of a mantra, and it goes like, <q>This too shall pass</q>. I try to recall this saying whenever I am feeling stressed and overwhelemd with school work. Here in college, the most memorable quoation that stuck to me so far is, <q>No guts, no glory.</q>
