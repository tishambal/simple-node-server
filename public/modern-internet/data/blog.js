document.getElementById("blogp2").innerHTML = "The first type of blogs was very difficult to use. Only programmers who were capable of creating their own custom blogging platform could use the blogs. These blogs were updated manually and were usually linked from a central home page or archive. This inefficient type of blog lead to the dawn of the recognizable and user-friendly blogging sites such as LiveJournal, which was considered the most recognizable at that time. Blogger, by Evan Williams and Meg Hourihan eventually followed and essentially brought blogging to the mainstream. "

Blogs such as Boing Boing, Dooce, Gizmodo, Gawker (the first major gossip blog), Wonkette, and Huffington Post were all launched in the same year. In 2001 Version 1.0 of Movable Type was released. It was followed by WordPress and TypePad (based on Movable Type) in 2003.

Anyone with Internet access can claim their own special place in the net and customize it to fully reflect the writer’s personality.  A blog mostly consists of the head, the side bar, the footer, and of course the body. The head is where the title and the main navigation menu are located. The sidebars are used to place ads, widgets, or your blog’s highlights. The footer is at the bottom area of the blog that displays content that doesn’t often change but is accessible for the readers. Lastly, the body is where the content of your blog can be seen. Readers can have the option to leave comments or feedbacks in your posts which creates a community element to bogs which makes it a medium of expressing and sharing "
