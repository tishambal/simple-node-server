document.getElementById("blogp1").innerHTML = "A message is composed on a computer by using an email program, which is considered your client. In order to send an email, it must contain an address in form of user@domain.ext. The client then sends the message off to an email server by using the Simple Message Transfer Protocol, or SMTP. The SMTP server is like your local post office, which checks your postage and address and figures out where to send your mail. SMTP server contacts a Domain Name System server (DNS) which serves as the address book. The message gets sent from that server to the target domain’s mail exchange server. This server is referred to as an MTA, or Mail Transfer Agent. It decides where exactly to put the mail. "
document.getElementById("blogp2").innerHTML = "The recipient’s mail program gets the messages through his ISP’s server. The mail program uses either the Post Office Protocol (POP) or Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) to fetch the message. "
document.getElementById("blogp3").innerHTML = "POP is useful because you “pop in” and collect all of your mail and then leave; it gets the message witing on the server and then transfer it back to the user’s computer and email program. POP does not necessarily need for the user to be connected in the internet because the message has arrived. Moreover; it is a unidirectional protocol wherein information travels one way. Once you download the email to a client, it’s up to the client to sort through its different statuses and so on."
document.getElementById("blog4").innerHTML = "IMAP on the other hand was designed to be “server-oriented,” and bi-directional.  Clients have a two-way communication with their servers and all messages are kept on the server so multiple clients can access them. When you check an email on your phone, it’s marked as read and during the next interaction with the server, that status is sent back so all other clients can be updated with it. IMAP also supports an offline mode; changes are synched with the server the next time you’re online."
