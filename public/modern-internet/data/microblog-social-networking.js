document.getElementById("blogp1").innerHTML = "The first account of social networking dated way back in 1978 in the dawn of the Bulletin Board System (BBS). The BBS was hosted on personal computers that required the users to dial in through the modem of the host computer and exchange information over phone lines with other users. This was the first system that allowed users to sign in and interact with each other. This process very inefficient because only one use could be logged in at a time."
document.getElementById("blogp2").innerHTML = "In 1994, the first social networking site that we are more familiar with today was launched and it was called Geocities. It allowed its users to create their own websites, dividing them into “cities” based on the website’s content. "
document.getElementById("blogp3").innerHTML = "In 1995, TheGlobe.com was launched, offering users the ability to interact with people who held the same interests and publish their own content."
document.getElementById("blogp4").innerHTML = "In 1997, instant messaging started to boom when AOL Instant Messenger and SixDegrees.com were launched. It was also the first time where users can create their profiles and “add” others users as “friends.” "
document.getElementById("blogp5").innerHTML = "These lead to the development of more efficient social networking sites that allowed users to share persona information and photos. Eventually, the pioneer of social networking, Friendster was born. It acquired 3 million users and was however cloned by MySpace in just 10 days of coding. "
document.getElementById("blogp6").innerHTML = "In the following years, other social networking websites like Classmates.com, LinkedIn and Tribe.net started to pop up, including what was to be the most popular social networking website in internet history."
document.getElementById("blogp7").innerHTML = "In 2004, Mark Zuckerberg launched a website with the intent to connect U.S. college students, starting with Harvard College which then eventually lead to the prime of Facebook. During its first months of operation, over 19, 500 college students from all over U.S. were connected through the site. A few months after, the site was available for non-college students and behold, the Facebook that we enjoy today. "
document.getElementById("blogp8").innerHTML = "With the popularity of Instant Relay Chat (IRC), chat status messages, and mobile phones, people started getting used to composing short messages on demand. They seek out such messages to gain awareness about what people in their social networks are doing. This is the world into which Evan Williams hatched his idea in 2007, Twitter. It was from this site that the term “microblogging” was coined from which referred to short status messages reporting on the details of one’s life. Communicating through microblogs seemed odd at first because of its limitations, however it was Williams’ intention to provide a platform that gave new power to short messages. "
